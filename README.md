This project is a prototype Android app that lets prospective pet owners match with pets who are looking to be adopted!

## Features
- Flip through pets found at local shelters and foster homes. See one you like? "Pounce" on it!
- Look through your favorite pets and their likes and dislikes
- Create a profile page which contains your own likes and dislikes to compare against pets'
- Directly contact the shelter of your favorite pets so you can adopt them!


## Our Story

We each have a good amount of programming experience from college in languages like Java and Python, but have never experienced developing a mobile app. When we saw the Flutter workshop before the hackathon started, we decided we would love to try our hand at it.

When discussing what type of app we'd make, lots of different ideas came up, including wellbeing and social media apps, but those aren't exactly silly... We also didn't want to make a mobile game since that felt too obvious. Finally, some "one trick pony" apps were proposed, such as something involving *whales in space*. But what we ultimately settled on has a lot more room for expanding in the future.

The four of us got together in one house for this hackathon, which currently has seven pets in it, one of which is a foster kitten! We all love pets and want to help find homes for those who need them. While this may not be strictly "silly", we had a lot of silly ideas along the way, like a tutorial that would show a cat's paw swiping through the app! Unfortunately we didn't get to implement many of those features, but we still had a lot of fun talking about them and drafting ideas.

Working in Flutter and learning the Dart language was fun, but challenging. Our first day was mostly drafting and watching tutorials, so most of our real development only happened in the last 24 hours. We divided the work through our Git repository, but hit a lot of speedbumps with merge conflicts. Our final app might not have every feature we wanted, but we are still very proud of what we created.
